      About Me

      <p id="AboutMe">
      I have been programming off and on for about a decade and have finally realized I want to make a career off of it. I am proficient with html and css and have been working with python, javascript and php respectively.
      When I was younger I learned that I enjoy building things with whatever was at hand, wether it was legos or me sitting on a computer in high school and using command prompt to see what I could do with it. I am looking for an entry level position to start building a career and begin to learn even more about programming in a team setting that will help increase my knowledge and skillset.

    Interests
    </p>
    <p id="InterestsText">
    My Interests include:
      <ul>
        <li>Reading Books: I started this at a very early age and that helped to increase my imagination to see things that others just cannot. It has increased my critical thinking and thought processing over the years to tackle problems that seem difficult at first until you slowly unravel the mystery behind them.</li>
        <li>Collecting Vinyl: I've been doing this for about 5 years now and it has helped me explore music I would not have stumbled upon before. A lot of people say digital sounds just as good but listening to Bill Withers sing live at Carnegie Hall on my record player cannot compare.</li>
        <li>Collecting Comic Books: I started collecting comic books this year after not buying one for close to two decades. It reminded me of my youth when I was able to watch my favorite characters protect those that needed saving and to defeat the ones causing terror to the masses.</li>
          </ul>
